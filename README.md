# timelog

## Summary

Timelog is a CLI time tracking application written in Go. It was 
written to aid me in tracking my time more efficiently. Plus, writting
a time tracking and todo application sounded like a fun project. At
this time, the primary focus of this application is to track and log
where I'm spending my time while I work.
